# Warp Terminal Container - Implementation Plan

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components

#### Warp Terminal Service
- Base: Debian Bullseye (slim)
- TTY Access: ttyd
- User: Non-root (warpuser)
- Tools: git, gh CLI, GPG
- Resource Limits:
  - CPU: 0.4 cores
  - Memory: 512MB

#### Reverse Proxy (Traefik v2)
- TLS Termination
- Let's Encrypt Integration
- HTTP -> HTTPS Redirection
- Authentication Middleware

### Security Architecture

#### Authentication
Two options under consideration:
1. Basic Auth
   - Secure credential storage
   - Simple deployment
   - Limited features

2. Keycloak SSO
   - Full SSO support
   - User management
   - More complex setup

#### Secret Management
- Docker secrets for sensitive data
- GPG key management
- GitHub tokens
- TLS certificates

#### Network Security
- Explicit network definition
- TLS 1.2+ requirement
- Internal service isolation

### Development Workflow

#### Container Build Process
1. Base image setup
2. Tool installation with verification
3. User configuration
4. Security hardening

#### Deployment Process
1. Secret initialization
2. Network setup
3. Service deployment
4. Certificate acquisition

### Monitoring & Operations

#### Health Checks
- Container status
- Resource utilization
- Certificate validity
- Authentication status

#### Maintenance
- Certificate renewal
- Security updates
- Backup procedures
- User management

## Implementation Phases

See progress_tracker.md for detailed phase plans and current status.

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- All secrets in Docker secrets
- TLS for all traffic
- GPG key isolation
- Volume permission management

### Access Control
- Authentication required
- Resource limitations
- Principle of least privilege
- Regular credential rotation

### Monitoring & Auditing
- Access logging
- Security event monitoring
- Resource usage tracking
- Error reporting

## Future Enhancements

### Scalability
- Multi-user support
- Session management
- Resource allocation
- Load balancing

### Integration
- Additional tool support
- CI/CD integration
- Monitoring systems
- Backup solutions
